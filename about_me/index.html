        <p>I am pursuing a Bachelor's in applied technology with a focus on computer programming and web design. I took some html and css long ago but didn't get very far.

            I have worked on websites in blogger and wordpress, and I have amateur level experience in Python. I hope to one day create a website for my art projects and webcomics, as well as gain a valuable career skill.
            
            I am excited to learn and be here!
