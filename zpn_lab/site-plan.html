You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        A main page for my website with easy links to to the pages and images, it is essentially a readers digest of my website.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        This website is a blog, gallery, and archive where I can share all my drawings, comics, stories, and other creations for all to see. All I want is a place where I can share my creations with the world that is easy to find and view stuff on. My creations the site’s content, and anyone who wants to see them are the audience. Honestly, I don’t have a specific target audience in mind, and would rather make stuff that anyone can enjoy than try to reach a specific audience. I suppose people who like comics, stories, art, and blog posts about them are the audience in mind, but like I said, my site will be something anyone can enjoy. Although I will not try to make it one everyone will.
        I may try to move it off GitHub in the future, but I will leave it on there for now. 
        Theme: I am not 100% sure but I may try to apply a theme to the site to make it more interesting, provided the theme does not distract from the content. I am considering an inventor’s workshop/mad scientist lab theme but doing so will require a change of the site’s color palette. Alternatively, I may stick to a library archive theme that require less alterations to the color palette.
        Requirements: The only requirements to view my website would be a steady internet connection and interest in my work. I don’t intend to paywall or sell anything yet, although if I become skilled enough that I could create work of enough quality to be worth selling I would. Although I probably would just use one of the Amazon publishing services for my comics and stories. I may try Google Ads for a little extra income, but only if I get enough traffic for it to be profitable. And if I could control what ads are featured on my site I would, so nothing contrary to my site’s family friendly tone appears. But then again ads are usually determined by people’s browsing history, so I doubt I can.
        Other:The only activities on my site will be viewing or reading my posts and drawings. This will be the only place to view them unless I post them to something like social media or deviant art, but as I do not particularly like those, I will probably refrain from doing so. When I produce all the content on the site, it is not likely they will find it anywhere else unless somebody rips me off. I am now typing thirty extra words to reach the six-hundred-word request by BYUI and as a sample of my impeccable, unique humor. Sonic Frontiers is totally it.

        Content: I have various plans for potential site content, and some already existing content, namely my webcomic Dogwood. Featuring webcomics, especially multiple ones should I start a new one will result in a lot images, but I am willing to take the risk. I would also like to write the occasional blog post about my creative process for those interested, so the site will feature a blog aspect to it. In a similar vein I may post short stories or essays written by myself on the site for people to read. These can be school projects, commentary on current events, or most likely, just stories I wrote and want to share with others. I am not a prolific writer, but it would be nice to write more. Lastly would be the drawings and pictures not directly linked to a specific project like a comic or story. I've considered taking up making dioramas, so pictures of those may be featured if I make any. Banana"
