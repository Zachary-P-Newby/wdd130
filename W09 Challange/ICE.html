                Narrator:	According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
                Cut to Barry's room, where he's picking out what to wear.
            Barry	Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Yeah, let's shake it up a little.
                Barry uses honey from a dispenser to style his hair, rinse his mouth, and then applies it to his armpits.
            Mom (Janet Benson)	(calling from downstairs:) Barry! Breakfast is ready!
            Barry:	Coming! (phone rings) Oh, hang on a second. (adjusts his antennas into a headset) Hello?
            Adam Flayman	(on the phone) Barry?
            Barry:	Adam?
            Adam:	Can you believe this is happening?
            Barry:	I can't believe it. I'll pick you up. (hangs up, sharpens his stinger) Lookin' sharp. (flies downstairs)
            Mom:	Barry, why don't you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those.
            Barry:	Sorry. I'm excited.
            Dad (Martin Benson):	Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. And a perfect report card, all B's.
            Mom:	Very proud. (touches Barry's hair)
            Barry:	Ma! I got a thing going here.
            Mom:	Ah, you got some lint on your fuzz.
            Barry:	Ow! That's me!
            Dad:	Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
            Barry:	Bye! (flies off)
            Mom:	Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
